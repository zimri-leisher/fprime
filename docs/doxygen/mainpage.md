The Fw package provides the core classes, components, and ports to support F´. These classes allow
for the core framework operation. In addition, these include the base classes on which components
are built.  Finally, of specific interest is Fw::Types providing the cored types in the system.


The Os package is an operating system abstraction layer. It provides basic Os system functions to
F´. This includes things like Mutexes, Queues, Tasks, and a File System.


The Svc package provides standard components to support greater F´ applications. This includes
command and data handling components used for more complete applications.


The Drv package provides drivers to support various hardware functions for F´. These drivers 
include a sample block driver component as well a various drivers that support Linux hardware
functions.


The Utils package provides classes for general applications in F´ projects. These classes are for
a variety of purposes.
