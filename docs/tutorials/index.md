-   <span class="card-title">__Hello World__</span>

    ---

    The Hello World tutorial shows how to create an F Prime project and how to design, implement, and test a basic F Prime component. We recommend that new users of F Prime start with this tutorial.

-   <span class="card-title">__LED Blinker__</span>

    ---

    The LED Blinker tutorial shows how to develop an F Prime project that runs on embedded hardware. It covers manager components, hardware drivers, and cross compilation, with the goal of blinking an LED on ARM hardware. This tutorial introduces the F Prime concepts of events, telemetry, commands, and parameters.

    > [!NOTE]
    > This tutorial can be run without hardware with the exception of section 6 “Running on Hardware”.

-   <span class="card-title">__Math Component__</span>

    ---

    The Math Component tutorial shows how to construct an F Prime application with user-defined ports and data types. It covers more advanced uses of events, telemetry, commands, and parameters. It also covers unit testing of F Prime components.
